A lot of the teams in the Big 10 are bunched together around 70 plays or more per game, with the entirety of the top-half of the teams averaging over 69 plays per game.

Add the weight of the average plays to the aesthetic and then reorder the teams by that weight. Add labels for the title and each axis.\nPenn State is way out in front among Big 10 teams in average plays per game up to this point in the 2023 season. Their 80.6 plays per game are over 7 more plays than second place, Purdue, and they’re averaging over 10 more plays per game this season than in 2022. Purdue and Wisconsin average over 70 plays per game as well to round out the top three, whilen Michigan and Iowa rank in the bottom two in the conference at less than 60 plays per game.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=big23plays, \n    aes(\n      x=reorder(TeamFull, avgPlays), weight = avgPlays)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Penn State atop Big 10 teams in average plays per game in 2023\", \n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Average Plays Per Game\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nDivide the sum of the entirety of the Big 10 teams’ 2022 plays by 14 to get the average number of plays for the conference.\n\n\nCode\nbig22plays |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avgPlays = (sum(avgPlays))/14\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  avgPlays\n     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     68.0\n\n\nDivide the sum of the entirety of the Big 10 teams’ 2023 plays by 14 to get the average number of plays for the conference.\n\n\nCode\nbig23plays |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avgPlays = (sum(avgPlays))/14\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  avgPlays\n     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     66.2\n\n\nThe biggest takeaway to me is that Big 10 teams are running slightly fewer plays per game this season than in 2022, but not by much. Despite the NCAA aiming to shorten games — and in turn, possessions — by a noticeable margin through the new first down rule, Big 10 teams aren’t even averaging two less plays per game. There’s an influx of certain teams running more plays on average in 2023 — most notably Penn State and Wisconsin — and an influx of certain teams running less plays on average in 2023 — most notably Northwestern and Indiana — but at the end of the day, on average, there are only slightly less plays being run for the Big 10 teams."
